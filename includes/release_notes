<p>Release 0.4
8th November 2016</p>

<p>Gunrock release 0.4 is a feature release that adds</p>

<ul>
<li>New optimizations to both advance and filter operators</li>
<li>Multi-iteration support for BFS, SSSP, BC, CC and PR</li>
<li>Better error handling</li>
<li>Updates on several interfaces</li>
<li>Overall performance improvement for both single and multi-GPU execution</li>
</ul>
<h1 id='v0-4-changelog'>v0.4 ChangeLog</h1>
<ul>
<li>Integrated direction-optimizing BFS with normal BFS. Now for BFS
there is only one executable, named bfs. The direction-optimizing
switch is enabled by the command-line option
<code>--direction-optimized</code>.</li>
<li>Added three new strategies for advance (triggered by setting
<code>ADVANCE_MODE</code> accordingly):

<ul>
<li><code>ALL_EDGES</code>, optimized for advance on all edges with all vertices
of the graph. With <code>ALL_EDGES</code>, there is no need to use sorted
search for load balancing, just binary search over the whole row
offsets array; used in CC.</li>
<li><code>LB_CULL</code>, fused LB advance with a subsequent CULL filter; used in
BFS, SSSP and BC.</li>
<li><code>LB_LIGHT_CULL</code>, fused <code>LB_LIGHT</code> advance with a subsequent CULL
filter; used in BFS, SSSP and BC.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added three new strategies of filter (triggered by setting
<code>FILTER_MODE</code> accordingly):

<ul>
<li><code>COMPACTED_CULL</code>, optimized on several culling heuristics</li>
<li><code>SIMPLIFIED</code>, another implementation of the CULL filter, without
some optimizations</li>
<li><code>BY_PASS</code>, optimized for a filter with no elements
to remove from the input frontier; used in CC and PR.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added multi-iteration support for BFS, SSSP, BC, CC and PR. Users
can set the number of iterations to run and specify the source node
for each run (if necessary) via <code>InitSetup()</code> defined in gunrock.h.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id='v0-4-known-issues'>v0.4 Known Issues</h1>
<ul>
<li>HITS and SALSA do not have CPU reference yet</li>
<li>HITS, SALSA, and who-to-Follow do not have multi-GPU support yet</li>
<li>An out-of-memory error (for graphs that approach the memory limit
of GPUs) will cause result validation to fail</li>
</ul>
